Python client to scrape government contracts updates from the FPDS website for the prior day.

The [Contract-Alerts-Run](https://github.com/MindPetal/contract-alerts/actions/workflows/contract-alerts-run.yaml) workflow pulls contract updates for specified contracts, NAICS/agencies each day and posts to a designated MS Teams channel. To run this you must obtain and configure as actions repo secrets:

```
   123456789:My Contract,098765432:Your Contract
```
- NAICS_LIST: A comma separated string on NAICS, agency names and abbr
```
   541512:THE+AGENCY+NAME:ABBR
```
- MS_URL: MS Teams webhook URL for your organization.
